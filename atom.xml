    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the past 5 years or so of my life I have had an iPhone in my pocket.  I have really enjoyed the experience for the most part and in the time leading up to this year, even the thought changing made me very uneasy.  I know it is just a phone, but there is something inside me that says it is more.  It seems like it is almost an extension of me.  It helps me with so many aspects of my life that trusting another phone or phone type with that responsibility is very traumatic.</p>

<p>The main reason I made the decision to switch from iOS to Android was the interaction between Apple and Google.  Google’s software for the most part is on almost all platforms.  You can use it or not use.  Apple on the other hand keeps their ecosystem closed and doesn’t allow others to play in their park.  I find it annoying that I can’t make Chrome my default browser in iOS.  I find it annoying that people using Android devices can’t participate in ‘Find My Friends’ or ‘iMessage’.  I find it annoying that when I click on navigation link in Safari, Twitter or Facebook it opens up in Apple Maps and not Google Maps.  There are no ways to change these default behaviors either.  Overall I’m just disappointed in the software.  Hardware is great, but honestly that just isn’t enough for me anymore.</p>

<p>Switching hasn’t been easy.  I’ve had struggles with things, like instant messaging, my new camera, etc…  Every time I struggle I’m not only getting frustrated personally, but I have my loving wife leaning over my shoulder saying, “that phone sucks” or “should have stayed with an iPhone”.  It is very annoying and I will say it hasn’t gone as smoothly as I had hoped.</p>

<p>So if you are like me and have recently migrated from iOS to the Android ecosystem or maybe you are considering the change, perhaps you might want to read on and hear about my experience.</p>

<p>I’m going to break this post into three main parts.  Things you need to know and do once you have changed.  Things that I like and obviously things that I don’t.</p>

<h2>What you need to know</h2>

<h3>iMessage</h3>

<p>First and the biggest hurdle I had to deal with was iMessage.  It was a huge pain to get my messaging straight with all my friends.  Here are the three steps I took to get my iMessage service disabled and back to being able to communicate with my friends and family either via SMS or messaging.</p>

<p>-Going to the <a href="https://supportprofile.apple.com/">apple support site</a> and removing my device from the device list.  I still have a couple apple devices so I just removed my phone.
-On my iPad and my Macbook Pro I completely disabled iMessaging.  You might still be able to use your Apple Id for messaging but it just seemed to complicate things in my scenario.<br/>
-Text ‘stop’ to the number ‘48369’.  You should get a response similar to: “FREE MSG: Apple iCloud ID Verification: You have been unsubscribed and will no longer receive messages.”</p>

<h3>Hangouts</h3>

<p>Now that you have iMessaging completely disabled you need to have a way to communicate with others.  The best solution I have found for this is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.talk">Hangouts</a>.  Hangouts has support for both iOS and Android platforms.</p>

<p>Finding people who use hangouts on iOS is not quite as easy, but they do exist.  In fact as of writing this iOS hangouts just got a very nice update and I would say the iOS version of hangouts is better than the Android version.  Go figure.  Hangouts allows you to message over your internet connection in Android and it also allows you to use SMS.  The unfortunate thing is you have to manually select your option.  Where Apple abstracts that responsibility from you, with hangouts you have to either choose the email address or the phone number.  This is mildly annoying.  I would think this is something the android market would be rectifying sooner than later to keep the messaging system as simple as possible.  Hangouts has the potential to be a very nice messaging platform and Google has all the technology required to make it amazing.  They just need to figure out a way to bring it all together in one application on all platforms.</p>

<h3>Find My Friends</h3>

<p>Another Apple proprietary application.  This has been another hurdle to jump in my migration but I think I have found the solution.  I use Google+ for managing my photos and for a more technical social network than Facebook.  Google+ allows you to track your location and so far my wife and I have been using Google+ for this feature.  There are quite a few other options out there that are supported on both iOS and Android, but I have yet to use any of them.</p>

<h2>Things I like</h2>

<h3>Google Integration</h3>

<p>When I set up the phone I sign in with my Google account and that is the last time I had to login.  The one negative aspect of this experience is the fact that I use ‘Two-Factor Authentication’ and I was unable to get my text initially to input my verification code.  I resolved this issue by using one of my backup phrases to get the phone initialized.  This might also have been partly to blame on not having disassociated my number with iMessage yet.</p>

<h3>Google Now</h3>

<p>Google Now has been amazing.  It is very well done and seems to understand my voice even in loud settings.  It also tries to predict my life a bit and help me makes decisions.  Google Now seems to know where I’m heading based on searches I’ve made, emails I’ve received, etc.  It also tries to help me find things to do and keep me updated on things that are important to me.  I always get information about my stocks, sports teams and the weather in the place I’m currently located and if I’m going somewhere soon, that location as well.  A lot of this functionality is available on iOS, however it isn’t as easy to access and because of that I seemed to use it quite a bit less.</p>

<h3>Back button</h3>

<p>Something so simple.  The back button.  This button has made navigation so much easier.  I find myself clicking on links that open Chrome, Instagram or Twitter and I can easily just push the back button and be right back where I was without any effort.  The multitask button I find to be quite useful as well.  I know iOS you can double click the home button to present all your applications that are open, but I can’t tell you how many times it hasn’t worked for me the first time and I’ve had to try again.  The multitasking button works every time and I find myself switching between applications with this function quite a bit.</p>

<h3>Swype</h3>

<p>I definitely haven’t mastered this technology yet, but I can definitely feel the potential.  I love how inaccurate you can be and the predictive algorithms still understand what I’m trying to type.  Plus it has the ability to plug into your social life and correlate names and emails in a manor that greatly assists you with texting.  I love that I no longer have to type my usernames and emails because it always remembers them for me.  This application needs to be on all devices, not just android.</p>

<h3>Play Store</h3>

<p>This was the most surprising aspect of my conversion.  I couldn’t believe how social the play store is in comparison to iTunes.  Unfortunately I don’t have a lot of friends that use this store, but for those that do, it is nice to see what applications they like and use their input when deciding on applications myself.</p>

<h3>More Control</h3>

<p>If I don’t want Chrome as the default browser I can change it. If I don’t like the default launcher I can change it.  There are so many things I can customize with this phone it is almost overwhelming.  I can definitely see good and bad in this ability, but for myself I love this aspect.  If I had a bit more creativity in my blood I would take advantage of this more.  On my Google+ feed there are people who post their current setup for the android device and some of the are ridiculously amazing.</p>

<h3>Installing APK’s</h3>

<p>This is something you just can’t do out of the box with an iOS device.  I can find an APK of an application I want to install and just put it on my phone and install it.  I am not required to go through the play store.  I have yet to try this with any other applications than ‘flappy bird’ and the google launcher that comes default with Nexus devices.</p>

<h2>Things I dislike</h2>

<h3>Camera</h3>

<p>Perhaps this is just my phone.  Perhaps it has something to do with Android itself.  I have yet to figure it out.  This is by far the most disappointing aspect of my new phone.  The quality of videos and photos that I’m producing are no where near where my iPhone 4s could produce let alone the new iPhone 5 or above.  I know everyone loves their Android phones and their respective cameras, but so far I have yet to see one that will compete with an iPhone.  I’m not talking about a book or a coffee mug picture where the object is stationary and in low or ideal lighting.  I’m talking about a trouble making kid that is running through a store doing something funny in low light or even normal light and you have very little time to capture the moment.  The pictures are passable.  The ones that are in focus you can usually put an instagram filter on top of it and no one will ever know.  The video isn’t quite as easy to hide.  There are things you can do, but I never used to have to do any of this in the past.  With the most recent update of Android 4.4.2 Kitkat I have seen some improvement, but it still is disappointing.</p>

<h3>Messaging</h3>

<p>This is such a huge part of my life and since moving to android it just hasn’t been as easy.  I would say 95% of my friends have iPhone’s so using iMessage was a very common situation.  Now that I don’t have this option I can’t easily communicate with my friends on my computer like I could with iMessage.  Hangouts has this option, but it doesn’t matter because very few people have hangouts on their iOS devices and you can’t SMS with hangouts.  There is a chrome extension called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/motorola-connect/kigmoblgooahdmdibodmcnffgnejlndh?hl=en">motorola connect</a> that lets you text via your browser which will suffice until something more elegant comes along.</p>

<h3>Updates</h3>

<p>I’m not a fan of Verizon getting an update before AT&amp;T or vice versa.  I find it really annoying to look at blog posts and photos of people showing off features or improvements of their phones that I’m not able to do because my carrier hasn’t updated my phone as of yet.  This isn’t a huge issue, but I still don’t have to like it.</p>

<h3>Screen interactions</h3>

<p>I’m finding that android doesn’t seem as accurate as my iOS device.  I don’t know if iOS does some decision making for me or something, but when I click on keys or links with Android I seem to miss a lot more often.  I also find that I get more actions that don’t produce any sort of response.  I think we always get things like this that happen no matter what type of device we use, but it just seems to happen a bit more on my android device.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Overall, I’m very happy I made the jump.  I just took a trip to Chicago where I was using it for directions and locations constantly and it worked amazing.  The voice activation features that come with the phone are sort of a gimmick, but they do have their uses.  Not the uses you see in the commercial, but I do use them for calling people when I’m driving without having to take my focus off the road.</p>

<p>Android is an amazing product. I am very excited about heading down this new road with Google and whoever else decides to tag along.  Open source has a great community around it.  Everyone is excited to share their products with you.  Now if I can just get this damn camera issue fixed.</p>

    <id>http://keroger2k.github.io/blog/2013/08/21/max-width-and-min-width-media-queries-in-internet-explorer-8-and-below</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever since <a href="www.twitter.com">Twitter Bootstrap</a> came about I&rsquo;ve been a huge fan.  It has been an awesome framework to utilize when working on rapid development and prototyping solutions for customer requirements.  For people who are not really UI strong, bootstrap has been a savior.</p>

<p>Recently I was working on website that I wanted to ensure was compatible with Internet Explorer 8 and I was using bootstrap.  After working on the page for a day or so in <a href="www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a> I thought it would be pretty close to identical.  I was wrong.  Bootstrap uses a CSS class called <code>.container</code> to mark the body of the document.  It has a <code>@media</code> query that sets the size of the <code>.container</code> class based on the size of the screen.  This allows for responsive design on desktops, tablets, phones, etc&hellip;  After a bit of searching on the web I discovered that although IE8 does respond to some <code>@media</code> queries it doesn&rsquo;t recognize <code>max-width</code> or <code>min-width</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond">Resond.js</a> to the rescue.</p>

<blockquote><p>How&#8217;s it work?</p><p>Basically, the script loops through the CSS referenced in the page and runs a regular expression or two on their contents to find media queries and their associated blocks of CSS. In Internet Explorer, the content of the stylesheet is impossible to retrieve in its pre-parsed state (which in IE 8-, means its media queries are removed from the text), so Respond.js re-requests the CSS files using Ajax and parses the text response from there. Be sure to configure your CSS files&#8217; caching properly so that this re-request doesn&#8217;t actually go to the server, hitting your browser cache instead.</p><p>From there, each media query block is appended to the head in order via style elements, and those style elements are enabled and disabled (read: appended and removed from the DOM) depending on how their min/max width compares with the browser width. The media attribute on the style elements will match that of the query in the CSS, so it could be &#8220;screen&#8221;, &#8220;projector&#8221;, or whatever you want. Any relative paths contained in the CSS will be prefixed by their stylesheet&#8217;s href, so image paths will direct to their proper destination</p></blockquote>


<p>After adding the <code>respond.js</code> script tag in my <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag and refreshing the page my problem was solved.  I also used a conditional clause to only load the script for IE8 or less.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/6299948.js?file=index.html'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;!--[if lt IE 9]&gt;
  &lt;script src=&quot;/js/respond.min.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;link href=&quot;/css/ie.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Hope this helps someone.  Not that it was a hard problem to solve, but it was shocking that Twitter Bootstrap didn&rsquo;t account for this issue.  Good luck.</p>

    <link href="http://keroger2k.github.io/blog/2012/09/20/enums-to-selectlist/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-20T16:48:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://keroger2k.github.io/blog/2012/09/20/enums-to-selectlist</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I had an interview where I was sharing my screen to a couple people who were watching me struggle through the simple task they had me complete.  I had to create a simple drop down list that contain three values and my first thought for whatever reason was to use an Enum and just bind that to a drop down list with the HTML helper object.  However, it had been awhile since I had actually had to do that and after about 1 minute of trying to get it to work I simply gave up and moved on as  I was on the clock.  After the interview I looked back at some code that I currently maintain and found my solution.  It definitely brought back some of the pain that went into the initial implementation.  Although the answer is quite simple, during the pressure of an interview I just couldn&rsquo;t recall.
Basically, I just used a generic extension method off of type TEnum.  This allows you to just reference a single value of the Enum do a ToSelectList();</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3726104.js?file=EnumExtensions.cs'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>
    public static SelectList ToSelectList&lt;TEnum&gt;(this TEnum enumObj) 
    {

        var values = from TEnum e in Enum.GetValues(typeof(TEnum))
                     select new { Value = e, Text = e.ToString() };

        return new SelectList(values, &quot;Value&quot;, &quot;Text&quot;, enumObj);
    }</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Here is an example usage:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3726104.js?file=HomeController.cs'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>  
    public enum QueryTypes
    {
        Web,
        Images,
        Documents
    }


    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public ActionResult Index()
        {
            ViewBag.Select = typeof(QueryTypes).ToSelectList();
            return View();
        }
    }</code></pre></noscript></div>

    <link href="http://keroger2k.github.io/blog/2012/06/17/happy-fathers-day/"/>
    <updated>2012-06-17T15:38:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://keroger2k.github.io/blog/2012/06/17/happy-fathers-day</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is Father&rsquo;s Day. It is probably the best holiday of the year now for me. You can have Christmas, you can definitely keep my birthday, Father&rsquo;s Day is the bees knees. My wife is also probably the worlds best gift giver in the entire world when it comes to holidays like these. She always finds just the right gift that is always very thoughtful and very cool. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m just crazy or weird, but it is definitely a love hate thing with me. I love it that I am the recipient of the awesome gift, but at the same time it puts a tremendous amount of pressure on for Mothers Day. I am not a good gift giver. My family has given me money for almost every holiday since I was in high school. There is no thought. There is no love in those gifts. It is just money. Boring money. My family always gives me the excuse that they don&rsquo;t want to buy me something I don&rsquo;t want and would rather I just get something I do want. Since I&rsquo;ve met my wife I&rsquo;ve discovered that that path is extremely lazy. Apparently? This Father&rsquo;s Day did not disappoint again. Got some amazing photography picture of my sons for my office and a book that probably took 6 weeks to put together. Basically I need to start working on her Mother&rsquo;s Day gift this week or I&rsquo;m going to be in trouble.</p>

<h2>Back to work</h2>

<p>Tomorrow is also my wife&rsquo;s first day back to work in ten weeks. Needless to say I don&rsquo;t think she was too into the Father&rsquo;s Day activities as she usually is? I can&rsquo;t imagine what it is like being a woman. I honestly don&rsquo;t know how ten weeks off of work and having to go back would affect me. I would like to think I would be upset, but I don&rsquo;t think it would be for the same reasons she is upset. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love both of my children with all my heart and I wish I could spend every moment with them, but at the same time, I just don&rsquo;t want to HAVE to work and I think that would be a huge portion of my disappointment.</p>

<p>This is our second child. Our first child is over 2.5 years old now and raising trouble every chance he gets. With the first child things didn&rsquo;t go quite as smoothly as the second child. So when it was time for her to go back to work, although she definitely didn&rsquo;t want to go back, she did. She only asked like once or twice to quit work. This time around though things have went quite a bit better, so I think going back to work is even harder for her because she was having so much fun this time around. Every time she asks if she can quit I always bring up finances as my way to keep her going to work. We do rely heavily on her salary. I have never really spent the time figuring if it would work or not, but on the surface it definitely appears as though it wouldn&rsquo;t because we tend to live &ldquo;paycheck-to-paycheck&rdquo; now. I think we could possibly make it work, but it would change everything in our life. It would be an enormous adjustment for all of us. Then the idea of being at home all day everyday with two kids and no money to go do things, might not sound as appealing.</p>

<p>It also sort of makes me feel like a failure as a father and a provider. I wish I did make more for our family so a decision like this would be simple. Unfortunately I don&rsquo;t. I just don&rsquo;t know how bad I should feel about my current situation. It isn&rsquo;t as though I&rsquo;m a failure in my life. I&rsquo;m definitely not the cream of the crop. She is a good looking woman. She definitely could have done better than me if she wanted. But I don&rsquo;t think our lives would be improved by her quitting. It would be worse for everyone. Raising two kids is a challenge. People always seem to say it is not that hard and I don&rsquo;t believe them. It is hard. At least it has been hard to this point. Two kids are a game changer. We are running a man-to-man defense here at the house. Actually its more like a Sun Tzu Art of War conqueor and divide strategy, but so far it is working. Perhaps it wil get easier when the kids get older, but right now it doesn&rsquo;t seem like that day will be here soon enough.</p>

<h2>Thankful</h2>

<p>This is all very random for me to write this and with the amount of traffic I&rsquo;m seeing on google analytic the likelihood that anyone reads this, besides me, is very slim, so please comment if you are the one person that happens to read this page. I really feel blessed this father&rsquo;s day in a lot of ways. My family is amazing. I have two great sons and a wonderful caring wife. She has done so many special things for me and I know I&rsquo;ll never be able to thank her enough. I hope in the future I can find a way to make her happy and make being a mom and more challenging, being married to me easier for her. I don&rsquo;t know if I will ever be able to say, &ldquo;make tomorrow your last day&rdquo;, but who knows. Perhaps tomorrow will be that day?</p>

    <link href="http://keroger2k.github.io/blog/2012/06/06/system-dot-net-dot-ip-dot-address-shortcomings/"/>
    <updated>2012-06-06T15:35:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://keroger2k.github.io/blog/2012/06/06/system-dot-net-dot-ip-dot-address-shortcomings</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;m going about this completely the wrong way, but from what I can tell, there really isn&rsquo;t much logic built into the framework for IP Addressing and C#. There is a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.ipaddress.aspx">System.Net.IPAddress</a> class that has some very limited capabilities IMO. I just don&rsquo;t understand why there isn&rsquo;t some additional functionality with this class or some sister class that helps simplify common tasks with IP address functionality. For example an IP address is mostly useless alone. Without a subnet mask you have no real sense of the IP address. Once you have the subnet mask you then can extrapolate all the details such as network address, broadcast address, size, etc&hellip; I wish the System.Net.IPAddress class allowed you to do more things like this natively.</p>

<p>Below are a few methods to help extend on the logic of System.Net.IPAddress. I thought I&rsquo;d share what has been completed so far. I&rsquo;ve also included the NUnit test cases that go along with this class to help with understanding what each of the methods are doing.</p>

    <link href="http://keroger2k.github.io/blog/2012/06/01/up-and-running-with-sinatra/"/>
    <updated>2012-06-01T00:13:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://keroger2k.github.io/blog/2012/06/01/up-and-running-with-sinatra</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing around with ruby on rails for quite some time now.  Although I&rsquo;m primarily a
.NET developer, I find rails a very interesting framework to develop with mainly because of the
community that is built around rails.  From inception to initial deployment can be minutes with
scaffolding, gemfiles and heroku at your disposal.  The community for rails is tremendous and just
about everything you can imagine has already been thought of and a gem created for you.  In the .NET world
only recently have we had something similar with <a href="http://nuget.org/">NuGet</a> and that has made quite an impact on how
things are done within the .NET world.</p>

<p>To get a better understanding of how rails works, I&rsquo;ve been trying out the microframework called <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>.  Sinatra is a very lightweight framework that doesn&rsquo;t abstract away a lot of what is truly happening.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>To get started create a simple directory framework for an application that for now will just serve up static content:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>- Hotel
</span><span class='line'>  - App\
</span><span class='line'>      - app.rb
</span><span class='line'>      - boot.rb
</span><span class='line'>      - hotel.rb
</span><span class='line'>  - Gemfile
</span><span class='line'>  - Rakefile
</span><span class='line'>  - config.ru
</span><span class='line'>  - Procfile
</span><span class='line'>  - Readme.md</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The &lsquo;Readme.md&rsquo; file is mainly for use with <a href="http://www.github.org">github</a>.  Github uses the readme file
for a way for the  author to explain the purpose of the application along with any helpful syntaxes, scenarios etc&hellip;</p>

<p>The Gemfile is what tells ruby what the dependencies are required to run the application.  You want to make sure you have
the Gemfile located in the root directory and the very first line should be a link to the source for the gems.  In this
example rubygems.org is being used.  Below the source are the list of gems that are required to get the sinatra
application up and running.</p>

<ul>
<li>rack (middleware that sits between your application and the server.  Handles API calls, HTTP params, etc&hellip;)</li>
<li>rake (software specifically designed for task within your application)</li>
<li>sinatra (Lightweight, simple, powerful DSL (Domain Specific Language) developed for ruby and reliant on rack)</li>
<li>mustache (templating framework for views)</li>
<li>foreman (Process management for Procfile-based applicaitons.)</li>
<li>thin (Webserver used to run application.)</li>
</ul>


<p>A lot of the gems above I used because <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>.  It just makes things easier for me.  There are a lot of great alternatives to mustache, thin, etc&hellip;, but I&rsquo;ll be using these in my examples.  There are also some gems for testing that I like to use, but they are not required for getting up and running.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2848476.js?file=Gemfile'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>source 'http://rubygems.org'
gem 'rack'
gem 'rake'
gem 'sinatra'
gem 'mustache'
gem 'foreman'
gem 'thin'

group :test do
  gem 'rack-test'
  gem 'mocha',        '~&gt;0.11.1'
end
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>The procfile is what foreman uses to start the thin webserver.  In the example below it is telling the thin webserver
to start up and use port 5050.  Once the webserver is up and running you will be able to preview the results by going to
<a href="http://localhost:5050">http://localhost:5050</a>.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2848476.js?file=Procfile'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>web:      bundle exec thin start -p 5050
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>The config.ru file is executed when the application is starting and instructs the application
to require certain libraries that we&rsquo;ve included.  In this example I&rsquo;ve put most of the require statements in a file called boot.rb and the first line is giving it the location to that file for the includes.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2848476.js?file=config.ru'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>require File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/app/boot')

map('/')         { run Hotel::App }</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>The boot.rb file isn&rsquo;t required, because it could all be put into the config.ru file, but this is a nice way
to keep the require statements for the application in a centralized place.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2848476.js?file=boot.rb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>$LOAD_PATH.unshift File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__))

require &quot;rubygems&quot;
require &quot;bundler/setup&quot;

require 'sinatra/base'
require 'mustache/sinatra'

require 'hotel'
require 'app'
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Using rake can be extremely powerful.  It allows you to configure common tasks within your application.  In the startup example there is only one task that needs to be performed, starting the application itself.  In this example it is telling foreman to start which in turn will read the Procfile in the root directory and foreman will start the thin webserver on the port 5050.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2848476.js?file=Rakefile'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>require 'rubygems'
require 'rake'

$LOAD_PATH.unshift File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/app')

require 'boot'

desc &quot;Start the server&quot;
task :start do
  Kernel.exec &quot;bundle exec foreman start&quot;
end</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>The app.rb is the meat of the application so far.  This class inherits from Sinatra::Base.  This is the base class for all Sinatra applications.  Here we are telling our Sinatra application to respond to only the &ldquo;/&rdquo; GET request.  So any other request currently will return a 404.  If a &ldquo;/&rdquo; GET request is received it will simply respond with the current time on the server.  Nothing fancy but proves that Sinatra is up and running correctly.  You will need to understand the different HTML
method definitions to layout responses for your Sinatra application.  The most commonly used methods are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2848476.js?file=app.rb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>module Hotel
  class App &lt; Sinatra::Base
    get &quot;/&quot; do
      &quot;Hello world, it's #{Time.now} at the server!&quot;
    end
  end
end</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Here is where application specific logic will be stored.  Nothing is currently required so this is an empty class currently.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2848476.js?file=hotel.rb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>module Hotel
end</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Once all theses file are created and in place.  Run &lsquo;rake start&rsquo; and visit <a href="http://localhost:5050">http://localhost:5050</a> to see the current time on the server.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this first post of mine I&rsquo;m not really showing too much of the functionality of Sinatra itself.  It is basically a guide on how to get up and running and what is required.  Although there is much less required to get started I think this is a good structure to start with for real applications.  If you want a bare bones up and running introduction the <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> has some great examples.</p>
